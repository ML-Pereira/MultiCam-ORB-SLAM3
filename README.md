# MultiCam-ORB-SLAM3

MultiCam-ORB-SLAM3 is an open-source expansion of the ORB-SLAM3 algorithm to multiple-camera systems using depth (RGB-D) cameras. Our system allows the optional use of multiple IMUs, accounting for depth cameras with integrated IMUs.

## TO BE RELEASED SOON.
### A paper presenting and evaluating MultiCam-ORB-SLAM3 is currently under review for a scientific publication.
